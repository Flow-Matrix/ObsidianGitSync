How dose the saline solution work 90% similar to Morphine medicine itself.. 

Morphine is a  CNS, Chemical, Pain-Blunter, for until the main medic comes 
But the placebo saline solution also worked just as find on bette feild? 

For solders there is aslos the ego power, after being told that morphine has been injected, this placebo reduced the risk of cardiac arrest during the surgery 

Self infliction? 
This is what reduced the actual power, is there even any actual use case of this? 
# What gives power to Placebos??
