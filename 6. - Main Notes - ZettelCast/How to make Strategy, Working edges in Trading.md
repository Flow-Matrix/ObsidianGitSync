Entries derived by the following makes Strong strategies :

#### Now some Techs to improve these strategies : 
Jxnx
1. Allower

#### What should, A Perfectly Awosome strategy should have : 

1.  Should have self filters 
	- like it shiuld reach entry by Steps! 
	- giving market to change to tell its story.. Ig okay 

2. The bounce pad, parameter 
	What a good bounce pad is like 
	- it helps to obtain as much as winning trades as possible while being as tight as possible 
	- yes, soem trades might reverse from its above or some might from its below, but we don't want that

	- imgin each of these green dots represents the reversal points, it will be like a gradient on different level fro where it reverses after the compete prepration of steps, 
	- now you want you bounce bad to be tight as possible while capturing most of the the reversal points too
