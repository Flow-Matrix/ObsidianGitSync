So what robotic checklist proposition 

It I'll help as a tag in each trade to know if it was taken according to Rules or not 

Is it malleable? 
Yes, it will be malleable, but AFTERwards of atleast of 2or3 evidienc first 
Be it ihe update in entry, target, or sl, will rruqirr 2 common paper evidences first, to update any rule in these robotic rules 

Con :
Yes, I might have to face some small loss 
, but it will definitely be favourable in long term if I really accept this , as i will be much much easy for me to remain away from temperorly pulled in this way, as so ig loses as well 
It's will be definetly like 
Metric  : pn following this rules, those huge psychotic tradings dd must be away then 
Because 
I will be the stopping at the decided SL no matter what for the day 

Pro :
Will remain a way from psycho and day badening
