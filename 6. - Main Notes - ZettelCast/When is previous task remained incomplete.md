|     | Needing to extra work, due to a element/pillar of completion getting altered/temperorly getting delayed | The destination  getting altered at the last moment | So will need to shift /. Redo all the work, basically it's extra work | I this case, I have to find alternate path for that pillar<br> (eg would got vanished on flipkart, so find alternative company's oil at similar price  on Amazon ) |
