[[Fixing Expectations, by Probability theory]], 



So ek Kaam ke success hone ki best probability kab hoti hai 

1. Jab tum prassan hoke, 100% focus karke uss Kaam ko kare ho (ye to kaam karte wakt ka traits ho gaya, (to har samay hi Accha hona ))

Suggestions : 

- Energy and Progress free hoke kare , aisa kuch pp me kro 
	- (Because, not every time this body mind is in its best of the best condition) 
	- It's just the time you spend with the bpps best probability points that counts 


### Bpps ko Decide kaise kiya jaye / ise kaise banaya jaye Bpps ko, kisi bhi Kaam ke 


What I am trying to do here 
Fidn the best possible train by some way or the other.. 
#### Bpps definitions : 
- Point A se Point B tak phonchne ki Best possible train / path.. 


##### When a work will be considered done best.. 
According to me 
- kaam pura ho jaye 
- plus, usmese learning/improvement nikalni ho to wo bhi mai kisi tarha to nikal pau 


#### What can help to make Bpps : 

- Top down analysis of the work you want to do/complete, super clarity of the end results.. Hmm 
	- [[Eg trail 01, for doing analysis for trading]]
	- so Step1 of Bpps can be this.. 
		- having super clarity of the end result you want in all way, and 'Writing it down'
