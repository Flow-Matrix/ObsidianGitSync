Importance/what is this  : 



Is it so 
That supposition dives almost everything 

When I am not able to do the best course of action that (that my ego/past infos) I am able to think in that moment, 
Then I feel bad 

Eg today 
A small girl asked for some hair clip to buy for her, which I did because I didn't have my own payout at this time 
Eg2, a vegetable vender or was kinda drunk ig and he was cussing everyone, I thought to correct him ig, but I couldn't because I didn't have the body plus didn't k ow the exact correct way to do so. 
So I had to move ahead, but at that moment I bothered me 
From the supposition is born, liek what I ma supposed to do according g to my own ego..
